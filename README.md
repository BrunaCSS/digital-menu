# Digital Menu

Welcome to the **Digital Menu** project! This is a simple, responsive web application designed to showcase a restaurant's menu in a clean and modern format. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can easily be customized to fit the needs of any restaurant, cafe or fast food. I developed this application as part of an assignment for my college course in Systems Analysis and Development, specifically for the Human-Machine Interface Usability discipline, utilizing principles of usability as outlined in the ISO 9241 standard.
